abstract = {Abstract In response to the increasing demand for the highly efficient design of materials, materials informatics has been proposed for using data and computational sciences to extract data features that provide insight into how properties track with microstructure variables. However, the general metrics of microstructural features often ignore the complexities of the microstructure geometry for many properties of interest. An independently developed machine learning tool called shiny materials genome integration system for phase and property analysis (ShinyMIPHA), which is designed with either standalone software or cloud system based on an R programing package of “Shiny”, is introduced. ShinyMIPHA provides topological microstructure analysis methods based on image processing technology by employing a two-point correlation function, persistent homology, and mean (H)–Gauss (K) curvature approaches, as well as sparse study and regression analysis methods that enable a data-driven properties-to-microstructure-to-processing inverse materials-design approach.

abstract = {Abstract Nature assembles a range of biological composites with remarkable mechanical properties despite being composed of relatively weak polymeric and ceramic components. However, the architectures of biomaterials cannot be considered as optimal designs for engineering applications since biomaterials are constantly evolving for multiple functions beyond carrying external loading. Here, it is aimed to develop an intelligent approach to design superior composites from scratch—starting from constituent materials. A systematic computational investigation of the effect of constituent materials (assumed to be perfectly brittle) on the behavior of composites using an integrated approach combining finite element method, molecular dynamics, and machine learning (ML) is reported. It is demonstrated that instead of using brute-force methods, machine learning is a much more efficient approach and can generate optimal designs with similar performance to those obtained from an exhaustive search. Furthermore, it is shown that the toughening and strengthening mechanism observed in composites at the continuum-scale by combining stiff and soft constituents is valid for nanomaterials as well. Results show that high-performing designs of graphene nanocomposites can be generated using our ML approach. This novel ML-based design framework can be applied to other material systems to study a variety of structure–property relationships over several length-scales.},

To address this issue, we propose the use of machine learning technique, namely Gaussian process regression, with a small number of full-field simulation results to construct structure-property linkages that are accurate over a wide range of microstructures.

ABSTRACT={Machine learning tools represent key enablers for empowering material scientists and engineers to accelerate the development of novel materials, processes and techniques. One of the aims of using such approaches in the field of materials science is to achieve high-throughput identification and quantification of essential features along the process-structure-property-performance chain. In this contribution, machine learning and statistical learning approaches are reviewed in terms of their successful application to specific problems in the field of continuum materials mechanics. They are categorized with respect to their type of task designated to be either descriptive, predictive or prescriptive; thus to ultimately achieve identification, prediction or even optimization of essential characteristics. The respective choice of the most appropriate machine learning approach highly depends on the specific use-case, type of material, kind of data involved, spatial and temporal scales, formats, and desired knowledge gain as well as affordable computational costs. Different examples are reviewed involving case-by-case dependent application of different types of artificial neural networks and other data-driven approaches such as support vector machines, decision trees and random forests as well as Bayesian learning, and model order reduction procedures such as principal component analysis, among others. These techniques are applied to accelerate the identification of material parameters or salient features for materials characterization, to support rapid design and optimization of novel materials or manufacturing methods, to improve and correct complex measurement devices, or to better understand and predict fatigue behavior, among other examples. Besides experimentally obtained datasets, numerous studies draw required information from simulation-based data mining. Altogether, it is shown that experiment- and simulation-based data mining in combination with machine leaning tools provide exceptional opportunities to enable highly reliant identification of fundamental interrelations within materials for characterization and optimization in a scale-bridging manner. Potentials of further utilizing applied machine learning in materials science and empowering significant acceleration of knowledge output are pointed out.}

In this work, the role of location-specific defect distribution and microstructure variation on fracture resistance of Ti–6Al–4V produced via different generation of Arcam machines (e.g. A2, A2X) is reported, along with the effects of subsequent hot isostatic pressing (HIP) treatments. Microstructure informatics of measured EBSD of α phase, reconstructed EBSD data for β phase, defect distributions from μCT scans, and fracture surface morphologies were used to establish correlations between microstructure and mechanical performance. In the fatigue crack growth tests, the fatigue threshold, Paris law slope, and stress intensity at overload were determined at various load ratios while fatigue precracked samples were also tested to determine the fracture toughness using an R-curve approach since samples were not thick enough for valid plane strain KIC. Distinct differences in both the magnitude of toughness and crack growth resistance behavior were documented for the as-deposited and HIP samples. Fracture surface examination and μCT scans revealed lack of fusion defects, disbonded regions, and random/isolated porosity for the as-deposited samples tested in this study. However, the resulting fracture/fatigue properties were in the range of those reported for the cast and wrought Ti–6Al–4V. HIPping eliminated the porosity/defects but HIPped samples exhibited coarsening of the α laths and changes to the magnitude of toughness and crack growth resistance."

This work investigates defect content of metal AM specimens and correlations between defect characteristics (size, sphericity/circularity, aspect ratio) using 2D and 3D defect characterization techniques. Distributions of defect characteristics based on location throughout AM specimens were analyzed and the variabilities of defect characteristics within these specimens were studied. Laser-Based Power Bed Fusion (L-PBF) specimens manufactured with different metals, different AM machines and built directions, different surface conditions, and different thicknesses were evaluated. Significant variability in defect characteristics based on location, especially in as-built surface specimens was observed. Well-optimized process parameters and post-processing reduced the overall volume fraction of defects, and the specified variabilities, and resulted in a more random dispersion of defects around the specimens. 2D and 3D defect analysis showed similar trends regarding correlations between defect characteristics and provided complementary information about the actual defect content based on their resolution."

In recent work, our research group has presented a novel framework called Materials Knowledge Systems (MKS) for the representation and calibration of the localization kernels, and demonstrated the viability of this approach on selected individual material systems. In this work, we present and demonstrate an important extension to the MKS framework that allows representation and calibration of the localization kernels for an entire class of materials (e.g., a selected class of single phase cubic polycrystalline materials)."

The initial morphological features of the structures were imaged by micro X-ray tomography. Moreover, the reconstructed model and as-designed model were compared to quantify the process-induced defects, which remained unavoidable due to complex manufacturing processes. The un-melted AlSi10Mg powders, sticking to the melting pool after condensation, intensified the deviation of side edges. Futhermore, the unevenly distributed process-induced defects resulted in anisotropic mechanical properties of AlSi10Mg alloy. Two finite element models were developed from X-ray tomography images and CAD model, which were simulated by finite element solver ABAQUS/Standard to discuss the effect of initial morphological features on the mechanical behavior of these samples. The geometric defects have slightly reduced Young's modulus and yield strength, but remarkably increased the equivalent plastic strain of the bulk structures. Furthermore, the ultimate strength and elongation, predicted by the image-based finite element model and the ductile failure criterion, was much lower than the values predicted by the as-designed model due to the influence of geometric defects."

We use X-ray computed tomography to capture morphology, location, and distribution of process-induced defects with the aim of studying their role in the elastic response, damage initiation, and failure evolution under quasi-static compression. Testing results from in-situ compression tomography show that each lattice exhibits a distinct failure mechanism that is governed not only by cell topology but also by geometric defects induced by additive manufacturing. Extracted from X-ray tomography images, the statistical distributions of three sets of defects, namely strut waviness, strut thickness variation, and strut oversizing, are used to develop numerical models of statistically representative lattices with imperfect geometry. Elastic and failure responses are predicted within 10% agreement from the experimental data. In addition, a computational study is presented to shed light into the relationship between the amplitude of selected defects and the reduction of elastic properties compared to their nominal values. The evolution of failure mechanisms is also explained with respect to strut oversizing, a parameter that can critically cause failure mode transitions that are not visible in defect-free lattices."

Failure after fatigue testing was found to initiate from surface or subsurface gas pores and fatigue life prediction equations were developed considering the influence of pores. The building direction did not have a statistically verifiable effect on the average gas porosity fraction, size and distribution, although the scatter in porosity fraction was greater in the vertically built specimens. At the same applied stress, the fatigue life of SLM manufactured specimens decreased with an increase in pore size, and specimens built horizontally exhibited a greater fatigue life than those built vertically. The cause is attributed to greater propensity of cracks to propagate along lower strength melt pool boundary layers in vertically built specimens."

With reference to the Ti6Al4V alloy and manufacturing by electron beam melting, we perform systematic finite element modeling of one-pass scanning to study the effects of beam size, beam power density, beam scan speed, and chamber bed temperature on the magnitude and distribution of residual stresses. Our study elucidates both qualitative and quantitative features of the residual stress fields originated by these manufacturing parameters.

abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies are considered revolutionary because they could fundamentally change the way products are designed. Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is a metal based AM process with significant and growing potential for the manufacture of aerospace components. Traditionally a material needs to be listed in the Metallic Materials Properties Development and Standardization (MMPDS) handbook if it is to be considered certified. However, this requires a considerable amount of test data to be generated on the materials mechanical properties. Therefore, the MMPDS certification process does not lend itself easily to the certification of AM components as the final component can have similar mechanical properties to wrought alloys combined with the defects associated with traditional casting and welding technologies. These defects can substantially decrease the fatigue life of a fabricated component. The primary purpose of this investigation was to study the fatigue behaviour of as-built Ti-6Al-4V (Ti64) samples. Fatigue tests were performed on the Ti-6Al-4V specimens built using SLM with a variety of layer thicknesses and build (vertical or horizontal) directions. Fractography revealed the presence of a range of manufacturing defects located at or near the surface of the specimens. The experimental results indicated that Lack-of-Fusion (LOF) defects were primarily responsible for fatigue crack initiation. The reduction in fatigue life appeared to be affected by the location, size and shape of the LOF defect.}

A crystal plasticity-finite element model is then used to simulate plastic deformation of the AM microstructures and a reference equiaxed microstructure. Results demonstrate that AM microstructures possess significant variability in strength and plastic anisotropy compared with conventional equiaxed microstructures.",

abstract = "A sample of 304L stainless steel manufactured by Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) was characterized in 3D using TriBeam tomography. The crystallographic, structural, and chemical properties of the as-deposited microstructure have been studied in detail. 3D characterization reveals complex grain morphologies and large orientation gradients, in excess of 10â, that are not easily interpreted from 2D cross-sections alone. Misorientations were calculated via a methodology that locates the initial location and orientation of grains that grow during the build process. For larger grains, misorientation increased along the direction of solidification. For grains with complex morphologies, K-means clustering in orientation space is demonstrated as a useful approach for determining the initial growth orientation. The gradients in misorientation directly tracked with gradients in chemistry predicted by a Scheil analysis. The accumulation of misorientation is linked to the solutal and thermal solidification path, offering potential design pathways for novel alloys more suited for additive manufacturing."

    abstract = { In additively manufactured (AM) metallic materials, the fundamental interrelationships that exist between composition, processing, and microstructure govern these materialsâ properties and potential improvements or reductions in performance. For example, by using AM, it is possible to achieve highly desirable microstructural features (e.g., highly refined precipitates) that could not otherwise be achieved by using conventional approaches. Simultaneously, opportunities exist to manage macro-level microstructural characteristics such as residual stress, porosity, and texture, the last of which might be desirable. To predictably realize optimal microstructures, it is necessary to establish a framework that integrates processing variables, alloy composition, and the resulting microstructure. Although such a framework is largely lacking for AM metallic materials, the basic scientific components of the framework exist in literature. This review considers these key components and presents them in a manner that highlights key interdependencies that would form an integrated framework to engineer microstructures using AM. }

abstract = "Dissimilar metal joints between ferritic and austenitic alloys are susceptible to premature failure due to diffusive carbon loss from the ferritic alloy driven by abrupt changes in carbon chemical potential. Compositional grading of transition joints fabricated using laser-based directed energy deposition additive manufacturing offers a means for limiting carbon diffusion. Here we fabricate functionally graded transition joints between a ferritic and austenitic alloy, characterize spatial variations of chemical composition, microstructure and hardness, and test their effectiveness to limit carbon loss from the ferritic alloy. Microstructural studies and carbon potential variations in the functionally graded material showed that the length of the joints can be shorter, and there is no benefit to continue compositional grading once the microstructure becomes fully austenitic. Since dissimilar joints have an expected lifetime of several decades, long service times were simulated through accelerated heat treatment experiments at elevated temperatures for both a dissimilar metal weld and a functionally graded transition joint. While the dissimilar weld showed pronounced carbon loss from the ferritic side, there was insignificant change in the carbon concentration profile in the functionally graded joint indicating effectiveness of the graded joints to perform under service conditions."

abstract = "Additively manufactured compositionally graded joints are potentially attractive to minimize abrupt changes in residual stresses and distortion of dissimilar alloy joints. Performance of these graded joints depends on the residual stresses and distortion governed by the transient temperature field during additive manufacturing and local mechanical properties of the joint. Here we develop, validate and utilize a thermo-mechanical model to provide a definitive way to additively manufacture sound graded joints for minimizing abrupt changes in residual stresses and distortion of the dissimilar joints. This model calculates residual stresses and distortion from accurate temperature fields calculated using a well-tested heat transfer and fluid flow model and temperature dependent alloy properties estimated by thermodynamic calculations. Both graded and dissimilar joints of 2.25Cr-1Mo steel to alloy 800H and Ti-6Al-4V to 800H, fabricated using laser-assisted powder based direct energy deposition process are examined. It is found that the sharp changes in residual stresses in dissimilar joints between Ti-6Al-4V and 800H can be effectively minimized by fabricating a graded joint between them. Although the magnitudes of residual stresses in Ti-6Al-4V to 800H joint are higher than that in 2.25Cr-1Mo steel to 800H joint, the former is less susceptible to warping, buckling and delamination due to the high room temperature yield strength of the Ti-6Al-4V substrate."
